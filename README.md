# 🚢 Titanic EDA Project
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset, identifying key patterns and visual insights into passenger survival.

📑 Project Structure
Jupyter notebook containing the full EDA process.

train.csv, test.csv, gender_submission.csv: Dataset files used for analysis.

(Optional) outputs/: Directory to store generated plots and reports.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

# 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights
Data Inspection: Using .info(), .describe(), .value_counts().

Visualizations:

Histograms of numeric features

Boxplots (Age vs Survived, Fare vs Survived)

Scatterplots (Fare vs Age)

Heatmap of feature correlations

Observations:

Younger passengers had better survival chances.

First-class passengers were more likely to survive.

Higher ticket fares were associated with better survival rates.

Most passengers traveled alone or with a small family.

# 📊 Key Findings
Socio-economic status (Pclass & Fare) heavily influenced survival.

Age and family size had moderate impact on survival probability.

Fare was positively correlated with survival, Pclass was negatively correlated.

Feature correlations provided helpful insight into the dataset for modeling.
